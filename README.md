# Senior Design Project
D&S Specialties is a small housekeeping company with a small team of one. Due to lack of automation, the business owner expenses a lot of time writing manual timesheets, payroll, schedules, and invoices to his employees. 
Using the Waterfall methodology and the Angular framework, our commitment was to create a mockup application that could potentially help the client with these issues.
